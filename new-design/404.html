      New documentary, <span style="font-style: italic;">All to Play For</span>, follows the journey of the 18 players that form the team FC Pol Positiu. Young men are the most at-risk demographic on the mental health compass. They have limited spaces where they can be open about their conditions, without the fear of stigma. The changing rooms, bench and pitch of FC Pol Positiu, are one of those spaces.
      <br><br>
      But health, like football, is rarely straightforward. As the season progresses, the team face struggles with both form and health, and certain members even find themselves watching from the side lines.
      <br><br>
      Can FC Pol Positiu stay on track? And can football continue to provide a source of hope and relief for the team? It’s all to play for.
