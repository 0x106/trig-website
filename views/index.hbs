        Trig Productions is a Barcelona based production company that specialises in creating commercial and documentary content. We create dynamic and stylised video content highlighting the stories behind the faces and brands that form this European cultural hub.<br><br>

        Before settling in Barcelona, Cianna Canning was the Audience Development Coordinator at New Zealand International Film Festival, Lindsay Hynds was a wildlife photographer in South Africa, and Nina Palmier-Robertson worked as an assistant producer in London.

We handle all aspects of production in-house in order to facilitate smooth communication and ensure the highest quality video content, from concept to screen.<br><br>

        New documentary, <span style="font-style: italic;">All to Play For</span>, follows the journey of the 18 players that form the team FC Pol Positiu. Young Men are the most at-risk demographic on the mental health compass. They have limited spaces where they can be open about their conditions, without the fear of stigma. The changing rooms, bench and pitch of FC Pol Positiu, are one of those spaces.
        <br><br>
        But health, like football, is rarely straightforward. As the season progresses, the team face struggles with both form and health, and certain members even find themselves watching from the side lines.
        <br><br>
        Can FC Pol Positiu stay on track? And can football continue to provide a source of hope and relief for the team? Itâ€™s all to play for.
