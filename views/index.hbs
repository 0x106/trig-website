          Originally from the UK, Ciannaâ€™s love for exploring different countries and cultures has led her to live in New Zealand, Singapore and now Spain.<br><br>
          â€‹Cianna has been drawn to visual media from a young age. This started with photography and has developed into a passion for the broader storytelling options
           that filmmaking offers. Her background centres around both fiction and documentary film exhibition, outreach and publicity. In more recent years she has moved
           into production, which has involved working as an editorial assistant for a web-based documentary project and as a co-director and producer.
